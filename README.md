# Malware Trends
This Python project was developed as part of a Studio project for Cybersecurity students. The goal of the project is to analyze malware trends using data scraping and API calls. It primarily targets a database available at https://mb-api.abuse.ch/api/v1/ to gather relevant data on specific malware groups. The main functionality of the script is to compare the number of entries of a specific malware group with other groups, providing insights on their relative prevalence and potentially other interesting data.

## Key Files
main.py
This is the main script for the project. It provides various configuration options, including the number of queries to run, the groups to analyze, and whether to use local databases or remote queries. It also defines several key functions:

get_groups(groups_list): This function gets the groups from a local file if no group list is provided.
write(): This function converts the JSON response to a CSV file and performs some cleaning and reformatting of the data.
stop(remaining_queries): This function stops the script and saves progress when the queries are exhausted​2​.
scraper.py
This script seems to be responsible for gathering and parsing the data from the API. It provides several key functions:

getData(): This function coordinates the data gathering process.
queryHash(hashes): This function queries the API for specific hashes.
compareHashes(h): This function compares a list of hashes against those found in response.json.
writeHash(hashes): This function writes the remaining hashes to hash.txt.
getHash(): This function retrieves hashes from a local database or from hash.txt if it exists and rehashing is not required.
searchSigTag(): This function seems to be related to searching for specific signatures or tags, although the full functionality is unclear without the full code​3​.

## Instructions
Download the hash lists from MalwareBazaar website and change the file name to full.cvs
Execute main.py
